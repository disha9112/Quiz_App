# QuizWhiz

**Tech Stack used**- Kotlin

QuizWhiz is a fun personality quiz game, where you navigate through 10 questions and based off the options you choose, you get to find which of the four elements- Air, Water, Earth, and Fire- you connect to the most.

The app starts with a welcome page containing a cardview, where the user is supposed to fill their name. While filling the name, the keyboard doesn't cover the rest of the UI elements used. If they try to proceed ahead without entering the name, a message pops up saying "Please enter your name".

Once the user is done entering their name and pressing on "Proceed to Game" button, they are taken to the first question. Here, they are supposed to choose one of the four options and click on "Submit". To make sure their response is locked, the option chosen turns green and the button says, "Go to next question". A progress bar has been set up, which keeps filling and displaying the number of questions the user has passed. A salient feature added is the Scroll View feature, which makes it more convenient for the user to interact with all the UI elements with a scroll feature.

As soon as the 10th question is reached and an option has been chosen and submitted, the button says "Finish", indicating the end of the quiz. Further from here, the user will be led to the results page, where their points and name will be displayed with a congratulatory message, and the element corresponding to the points is mentioned below. Clicking on "Exit" button leads them to the start of the app again.
